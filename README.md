# AlgorithDesignExercises
Here you can find the two homeworks that I've developped during my MSC in Algorithm Design.

There are 2 files for each homework: one with the requests and the other with my solutions.
Here's the list of topics covered during the lecture and in the 2 Homeworks:

 - Stable Matching 
 - Network Flow: Ford and Fulkerson, Capacity Scaling, Shortest Augmenting Paths
 - Perfect Matching, Circulations, Improved algorithm for bipartite matching (Ascending Price Matching, Hopcroft-Karp)
 - Greedy Algorithms
 - Dynamic Programming
 - Basics of complexity and NP-completeness
 - Basics of approximation algorithms
 - Basics of approximation algorithms
 - Linear Programming based approximation algorithms
 - Basics of Randomized Algorithms
 - Introduction to Game Theory and Equilibria Computation
 - Computing Equilibria in Zero-Sum Games and Efficiency of Equilibria
 - Selfish Routing and Price of Anarchy
